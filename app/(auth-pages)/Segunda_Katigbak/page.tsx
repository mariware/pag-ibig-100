          <p>
            Segunda Katigbak occupies a unique place in José Rizal's life as his first romantic infatuation, often described as "puppy love" and marked by "love at first sight." Rizal, then a 16-year-old student, met Segunda in 1887 during a visit to his grandmother in Manila. Segunda, two years younger and a student at La Concordia College, was admired by Rizal for her physical charm, which he vividly recorded in his diary. Their meetings grew more frequent as Rizal visited his sister Olympia at the same school, motivated largely by his budding affection for Segunda. The intensity of their connection was symbolized by an exchange of gifts—an artificial rose crafted by Segunda and a pencil sketch of her drawn by Rizal.

            Despite their growing intimacy, their romance was destined to be unfulfilled. Segunda was already engaged to Manuel Luz, a fellow townsman, a fact that Rizal learned later. This revelation, combined with Rizal's sense of delicadeza (honor), prevented him from pursuing her further. Their relationship ended poignantly when Rizal, though initially eager to meet her again, chose not to follow her carriage as she departed Biñan. This decisive moment marked the conclusion of their brief but heartfelt love story, leaving a lasting impression on Rizal's early emotional life.
