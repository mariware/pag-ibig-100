          Lucia Rizal, the fifth child of Don Francisco and Doña Teodora, was largely involved during times of political unrest. Lucia married Mariano Herbosa, and the couple became embroiled in the Calamba agrarian unrest, which led to charges of inciting rebellion and their eventual deportation order along with other Rizal family members. Lucia's life was marked by personal loss and the continued oppression of her family under Spanish colonial rule. After her husband, Mariano, died during the cholera epidemic in 1889, he was denied a Catholic burial due to the friars' animosity toward his connection to José. This incident led to José's public criticism of the friars in his article "<i>Una profanación</i>," in which he denounced their refusal to bury Mariano as an affront to Christian values. Later, in 1891, Lucia joined José and other family members for a reunion in Hong Kong, but her life would again be disrupted when, in 1892, José was imprisoned and deported on false charges linked to pamphlets allegedly found in Lucia's luggage. Lucia's love and loyalty were clear even though she had her own share of personal hardships.
